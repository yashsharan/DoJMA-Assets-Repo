<Title, can be of any desired length as long as it consists of a single line,just don't press enter :P>
<Date, should be of the format 'yyyyMMdd' , you may wonder why i didn't use small 'm', because samll m is used for minutes, though it doesn't matter much here. no harm in learning new stuff right? just like how you learned that this sentence is fricking long yet a single line>
<Time, should be of the format HHmm, capital H denotes time in 24 hr format>
<Location, same like title>
<Details, same like title, >
